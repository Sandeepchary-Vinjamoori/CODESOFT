This Python code implements a simple movie recommendation system using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization technique and cosine similarity. It uses a dataset of movies containing information such as titles, overviews, and other details. The TF-IDF vectorization is applied to the movie overviews to convert them into numerical vectors. The cosine similarity is then calculated between these vectors to determine the similarity between movies based on their overviews.
